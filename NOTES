TODO:
move/delete clips when completed -- can do the whole folder after 2 days or something
automate adding the video to a playlist
Upload the clips to their individual channels based on the game???
    - Kyle said he would be subbed if he was able to only select the games he wanted to see
        - This would be good since there are a lot of clips uploaded daily and would possibly retain more subs
        - This would remove some of the new games from being exposed to current subs though, so less known vids might get less views
Create a work flow for the clips so that we can have the process be more parallel
    - This should get rid of the need to do things by date all the time, and we could use the download date instead.
    - Download the clips, after they are all downloaded then add the clips to a db table
        - clips_to_combine
            - clip_id
            - clip_description
            - clip_info_path
            - clip_path
            - clip_download_date_utc
    - After clips are done encoding and combining, add them to a db table to be uploaded
        - clips_to_upload
            - combined_clip_id
            - combined_clip_path
            - combined_clip_tags
            - combined_clip_description
            - combined_clip_download_date_utc
            - yt_video_id
            - yt_video_url
            - yt_video_upload_date_utc
figure out a way to overlay the chat over the video???
    - this would be tough but would definitely help with the fair use issue if one arises
    - show chat on the side of the video or overlay on top?
iterate over a list of search terms for generating tags
    - can we automate this too by seeing what popular searches were?
generate the clips from the vods based on chat activity
    - need a database for storing the moving averages and baseline data per channel
    - establish a baseline per channel
    - upload ~15 seconds before increase in activity and ~15 seconds after activity is normalized
ask streamers if they want daily recap videos posted to their youtube channels, license software as a service or let them do it for a fee to download software
post to social media when the upload completes
    - maybe just on a weekly basis for most popular clip? don't want to get banned
    - reddit, subreddits:
    - 4chan
    - twitter
